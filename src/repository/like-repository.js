/**
 In JavaScript, the extends keyword is used in class declarations to create a subclass that 
 inherits properties and methods from a parent class. This is part of the class-based inheritance 
 model in JavaScript.

Explanation:
Inheritance: By using extends, the likeRepository class inherits from the crudRepository class. This 
means that likeRepository will have access to all the methods and properties defined in crudRepository.

Code Reusability: Inheriting from a parent class allows you to reuse code. If crudRepository has common 
functionality (like methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data), likeRepository can use 
those methods without having to redefine them.

Polymorphism: You can override methods from the parent class in the subclass. This allows you to provide
 specific implementations in likeRepository while still retaining the structure of crudRepository.

Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate:

class crudRepository {
    create(item) {
        console.log("Creating item:", item);
    }
}

class likeRepository extends crudRepository {
    like(item) {
        console.log("Liking item:", item);
    }
}

const likes = new likeRepository();
likes.create("Post 1"); // Inherited method
likes.like("Post 1");   // Specific method
